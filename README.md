# Semantic Web-Based E-Learning Management System

This project implements an e-learning management system enhanced with Semantic Web technologies to improve learning efficiency, adaptability, and intelligent content delivery. It leverages ontologies and reasoning engines to provide personalized learning paths based on topic relationships and user progress.

## Overview

Unlike traditional e-learning platforms, this system uses Semantic Web principles to understand the relationships between topics. This allows it to:

- Recommend the next best topic to study.
- Adapt to individual learning paths and pace.
- Organize content based on meaning rather than static categories.

---

## Features

- Semantic content organization.
- Intelligent course recommendations.
- Ontology-based knowledge representation.
- Interactive and dynamic learning paths.
- Adaptive content delivery based on learner behavior.

---

## System Architecture

This is a monolithic full-stack web application. Here's how it works:

1. Users interact via Flask-rendered HTML templates.
2. Backend handles login, course tracking, and reasoning logic.
3. Semantic knowledge is loaded from OWL files.
4. RDFLib and OWLReady2 query and infer learning paths.
5. SQLAlchemy stores users, sessions, and learning progress.

## Technology Stack

| Component           | Technology               |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Web Framework       | Flask                    |
| Frontend            | HTML/CSS/JS (Jinja2)     |
| Database ORM        | SQLAlchemy               |
| User Authentication | Flask-Login              |
| Ontology Management | OWLReady2                |
| Semantic Reasoning  | RDFLib                   |
| Data Format         | OWL/RDF (Turtle/XML)     |

## Semantic Web Components

- **Ontology**: Defines topics and their relationships (e.g., Algebra is a subset of Mathematics).
- **RDF Triples**: Represent knowledge as structured facts (`subject-predicate-object`).
- **SPARQL**: Query language to extract relevant semantic data.
- **OWLReady2**: Python-based ontology management system for loading and reasoning with OWL files.
- **Reasoning**: The system infers logical outcomes based on learner activity (e.g., unlocking Calculus after completing Algebra).

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-elearning-system.git
   cd semantic-elearning-system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:

   Ensure the database is properly set up before running the application. Use the provided database migration or initialization script if available.

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**:

   ```text
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Seed Data / Sample Content Loader

This project includes a utility to seed the database with realistic data for testing and demonstration purposes.

### What it does

1. **Creates an admin user**:
   A default admin account is added if one doesn't exist (with preset email and password).

2. **Adds sample courses**, such as:
   - Introduction to Python
   - Web Development Fundamentals
   - Cloud Architecture and Design
   - Advanced Cybersecurity
   - Data Engineering Pipeline Design
   - Cross-Platform Mobile Development
   - DevOps and CI/CD
   - AI and Machine Learning Engineering
   - Blockchain Development
   - Microservices Architecture

3. **Adds lessons and quizzes** (currently for Python and Web Development), including:
   - Lesson titles, content, and lesson numbers.
   - Quizzes with multiple-choice questions and options.

### Notes

- Each course includes metadata like title, description, semantic tags, student limits, and duration.
- Lessons and quizzes are fully linked to their respective courses.
- Raises exceptions if there are database issues.

> This feature is useful for developers and testers to explore the application with meaningful content out of the box.

---

## Usage

- Register or log in to the platform.
- Browse available learning modules.
- Follow system-generated learning paths.
- Mark topics as completed and track progress.
- Receive intelligent recommendations for next steps.

---

## API Structure

If using API endpoints for a frontend or external integration, here is a basic structure:

### GET /recommendations

Returns a list of recommended topics for the current user.

```json
[
  {
    "topic": "Linear Equations",
    "prerequisite": "Algebra",
    "status": "available"
  }
]
```

### POST /progress/update

Marks a topic as completed for a given user.

```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "topic": "Algebra",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

---

## Future Improvements

- Replace Jinja templates with a modern frontend framework (React, Vue).
- Implement REST or GraphQL API.
- Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for advanced reasoning.
- Add real-time feedback and progress tracking.
- Introduce multimedia support and quizzes.
- Gamify learning with achievements and levels.
